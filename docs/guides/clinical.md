# Clinical history beside the images

Format 1.1 lets a sample carry the subject's clinical history next to the images: laboratory values,
reports and their revisions, diagnoses, medications, assessments --- each with **when it happened**
and **when it became known**. This page shows how to write that history, read it back, ask what was
known at a moment, and add it to files you already have. The rules are [MEDH5 1.1](../spec/medh5-1.1.md);
the cohort used below is the one
[`docs/examples/clinical_longitudinal.py`](../examples/clinical_longitudinal.py) writes.

Nothing changes for imaging-only data: a sample without clinical records is still written as 1.0.

## Write a history

Times are signed microseconds on one **subject clock**, and every time is a pair of inclusive bounds:
an exact instant is one integer, a date known to the day is the day's bounds, and an unknown time is
`None` --- never a guess. Declare the clock first; then add events, documents and the links between
them and the imaging objects.

```python
import numpy as np
import medh5
from medh5.clinical import DAY, HOUR, Clock, Document, Event, Link

with medh5.create("history.medh5", sample_id="P-07", subject_id="P-07") as w:
    w.add_grid("ct", shape=(8, 16, 16), spacing=(2.0, 0.8, 0.8))
    w.add_image("CT", np.zeros((8, 16, 16), np.int16), grid="ct", modality="CT")

    w.set_clock(Clock.relative("clock", "acquisition start of the baseline CT"))
    # The scan, available an hour after it was acquired.
    w.add_event(Event("ct0", "ct0", "imaging", "point", "final",
                      effective_start_us=0, available_us=HOUR, timepoint_id="tp0"))
    w.add_link(Link.between(("event", "ct0"), "describes", ("image", "CT")))
    # A creatinine drawn two days before the scan: no imaging timepoint needed.
    w.add_event(Event("lab0", "lab0", "observation", "point", "final",
                      effective_start_us=-2 * DAY, available_us=-2 * DAY + 3 * HOUR,
                      code_system="http://loinc.org", code="2160-0",
                      value_num=1.1, unit="mg/dL"))
    # A report: the event owns its timing, the document its text.
    w.add_event(Event("rep_v1", "rep", "document", "point", "preliminary",
                      effective_start_us=0, available_us=4 * HOUR))
    w.add_document(Document("rep_text_v1", "Preliminary read: 14 mm nodule."))
    w.add_link(Link.between(("event", "rep_v1"), "describes", ("document", "rep_text_v1")))

with medh5.open("history.medh5") as s:
    assert s.version == "1.1" and "clinical" in s.profiles
    assert [e.event_id for e in s.clinical.events] == ["lab0", "ct0", "rep_v1"]
```

The writer checks every record as it is added and the whole history at `commit`, as it does for
images: a `point` without a start, a numeric value with a unit but no code, a link to an image that
does not exist --- each is refused with its diagnostic code rather than written.

A few rules carry most of the meaning:

- **A version is immutable.** A revised report is a new event with the same `record_id` and a new
  document, linked to the old version by `supersedes` --- never an edit of the old row. A measurement
  corrected later, or an interval whose end was learned later, is a new version too.
- **Unknown stays unknown.** Leave `available_us` as `None` when the source does not say; never
  substitute the time the data was ingested. Strict selection will then never use the event, which is
  the honest outcome.
- **A missing result is not a negative.** Record an expected result that is absent with
  `missing_reason`, and no value.
- **Clinical codes are strings.** They never share the segmentation label set's `uint16` class ids,
  however many concepts a cohort has.

## Revise a record

```python
from medh5.clinical import HOUR, Document, Event, Link

with medh5.amend("cohort/P-03.medh5") as w:
    w.add_event(Event("report0_v3", "report0", "document", "point", "amended",
                      effective_start_us=0, available_us=72 * HOUR))
    w.add_document(Document("report0_text_v3", "Addendum: nodule unchanged on review."))
    w.add_link(Link.between(("event", "report0_v3"), "describes",
                            ("document", "report0_text_v3")))
    w.add_link(Link.between(("event", "report0_v3"), "supersedes", ("event", "report0_v2")))
```

The amendment is copy-on-write like any other: images and annotations are copied as stored, their
digests unchanged, and the sample gets a new `content_id` because its content changed.

## Ask what was known at a moment

`select` answers with the engine's strict prospective rules (1.1 §9): only versions known available
by the cutoff, the newest of each record, and only the images, documents and annotations those
versions attest.

```python
from medh5.clinical import HOUR

with medh5.open("cohort/P-03.medh5") as s:
    at_day_one = s.clinical.select(24 * HOUR)
    assert at_day_one.certified
    assert at_day_one.event_ids == ["lab0", "ct0", "report0_v1"]   # not v2, not ct1
    assert at_day_one.admits("document", "report0_text_v1")
    assert not at_day_one.admits("image", "CT_tp1")
    text = s.clinical.text("report0_text_v1")      # read when asked for
```

A later revision whose availability is unknown --- or straddles the cutoff --- makes the selection
**uncertifiable** rather than silently handing back the older version: whether the older version was
still current at the cutoff is exactly what is unknown. `latest_provable` is the one named
alternative, and says so in its status:

```python
from medh5.clinical import HOUR

with medh5.open("cohort/P-03.medh5") as s:
    provable = s.clinical.select(24 * HOUR, policy="latest_provable")
    assert provable.status == "provable"
```

The same answer from the command line:

```bash
medh5 clinical show cohort/P-03.medh5
medh5 clinical select cohort/P-03.medh5 --cutoff-hours 24
```

## Add a history to a 1.0 file

`augment` copies a sample's objects as stored --- their digests do not change --- adds the records,
and writes a 1.1 sample with a new identity. It reports what the records leave unknown, and refuses
a `clinical` group it did not write rather than reinterpret it.

```python
import medh5.clinical as clinical
from medh5.clinical import HOUR, Clock, ClinicalRecords, Event, Link

records = ClinicalRecords(
    Clock.relative("clock", "acquisition start of CT_tp0"),
    events=(Event("ct0", "ct0", "imaging", "point", "final",
                  effective_start_us=0, available_us=HOUR, timepoint_id="tp0"),),
    links=(Link.between(("event", "ct0"), "describes", ("image", "CT_tp0")),),
)
report = clinical.augment("case.medh5", records, out="case-1.1.medh5")
assert report["version_after"] == "1.1" and report["unchanged_digests"] > 0
```

Visit dates you already have can seed day-precision imaging events; their availability stays
unknown, and the notes say so:

```python
import medh5.clinical as clinical

events, links, notes = clinical.imaging_events_from_timepoints("case.medh5")
clock = clinical.baseline_day_clock("clock")
```

The command line takes the same records as a logical-record bundle --- the JSON
`ClinicalRecords.to_json()` returns and `medh5 clinical export` writes, checked against
`medh5-clinical-1.schema.json`:

```bash
medh5 clinical export cohort/P-03.medh5 --out P-03-records.json
medh5 clinical augment case.medh5 case-records.json --out case-1.1.medh5
```

## Remove it again

The imaging projection is a separate, requested operation, never an amendment: the result is a
different sample, written as 1.0, and the loss is reported.

```bash
medh5 clinical strip cohort/P-03.medh5 --out P-03-imaging.medh5
```

## Check it

```bash
medh5 validate cohort/P-03.medh5 --level integrity
```

Clinical tables are checked like everything else: the column encoding, the records, and --- at
`integrity` --- every clinical dataset's digest, recomputed from the bytes, so an edit to a report
is found even when the stored `content_id` was left alone. A file of a **later** minor version than
this package implements is read as a projection: what is known is validated, what is not is reported
as `W913`, and the file is never amended.
