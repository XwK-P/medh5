"""The label space: label sets and the vocabulary registry (spec §5).

Annotations reference classes by ``uint16`` id and never by name, so a label set
is the only thing standing between an integer and a diagnosis.  Two properties
matter more than the data model:

* The hierarchy is a **DAG, not a tree**.  ``left_kidney`` is a ``kidney`` and is
  part of the urinary system; forcing that into a tree loses one of the two.
* ``closure`` is declared per annotation, never inferred.  A reader that helpfully
  adds ``liver`` because ``liver_segment_iv`` is present has invented ground
  truth, so the spec forbids it unless ``closure = "implicit"`` says otherwise.

The classes are the engine's (``medh5._core``): construction validates §5.1-§5.3
and ``to_json`` is the canonical serialization, in every language binding alike.

Three vocabularies ship with the engine, chosen because they cover the shapes a
label set can take rather than because they are exhaustive: one class
(``binary-foreground``), a small hierarchy with overlap-capable sub-regions
(``brats-subregions``), and a flat multi-organ set (``amos22-organs``).

**No ontology codes are bundled.**  A wrong SNOMED-CT or FMA binding is a silent
data-integrity defect that propagates into every file written with the
vocabulary, and it is not detectable by any validator.  Bindings are the
curator's to add --- :class:`OntologyCode` exists for exactly that --- and the
validator's W912 says so when they are missing.
